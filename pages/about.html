<p>I am a student at DeVry University working toward an Associates of Science in Information Technology and Networking. With a GPA of 3.7 I am looking forward to graduating in August of 2023.</p>
<p>I am also participating in the
  <a href="https://www.pnw.edu/cybersecurity/cwct/" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Workforce Certification Training</a>
  program, a certification based national training program for transitioning military, first responders, and other adult trainees. The CWCT prepares students to sit for CompTIA A+, Linux+, Security+, Red Hat Certified System Administrator, Cisco CyberOps Associate, and EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker and is supported by a National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity Grant, housed at the National Security Agency.</p>
